# Not_So_Basic_CAD

In Not So Basic CAD, we had two assignments. One was "Sweeps and Lofts" and the other was called "A Little Practice". For both, we went to SolidWorks and used the tutorials to build these four things. In Sweeps and Lofts we were told to build a candle stick and a hammer head. The hammer was a bit harder for me to figure out than the candle stick and took a little longer.

The Candle Stick was easy for me. It was a pretty straight forward project. I didn't have any problems making it.

In this project, we had to build a hammer head, using loft features. We had to create several planes and I struggle with that. It took me a while to figure out how to do that correctly. Bending the piece was also kind of challenging because there was a certain point we had bend and it was hard to find it.
